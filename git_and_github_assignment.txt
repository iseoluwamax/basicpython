git and GitHub assignment.

moving forward, all your assignment will be submitted using GitHub.
for all that we have talked about so far, it will be in one repo called 
basicpython

Secondly, each assignment topic will be in it's own folder, for example:
all assignments on functions will be in a folder called functions. All assignment on conditional statements will be on a folder called conditional statements.
Please note: there can be sub folders as well, that is; folder within a folder. Example:
In a topic called data structures, we will talk about lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets. all assignment will be in their own folder, which is inside data structures.
Finally, all folders must have a readme file which will describe what it does, using markdown.
